Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a C-based program used to sort a user-specified  
data set using one of four sorting techniques below:

* Insertion Sort 
* Merge Sort 
* Heap Sort 
* Quick Sort

The code will make a sorted data file formated as:  
>"sort letter"_filename.txt.sorted

It will also provide a stats file named:  
>"sort letter"_filename.txt.stats

How to Use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The code is ran as followed in a linux enviroment:  
> ./MySort "sort letter" "file name"

"sort letter" is the first letter of the algorithm's name

"file name" is the name of a text document containing the data to sort
